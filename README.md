# The Bibites Mod Manager
The Bibites Mod Manager is the unofficial mod manager for The Bibite programmed in python using tkinter. TBMM allows users to install mods with a simple gui instead off having to replace any dll manualy.
You can download and install mods with a few button clicks.
And can play you can play both vanilla and modded with one install of The Bibites.

### If you find any bugs please report them [here](https://github.com/MeltingDiamond/TBMM/issues) to help make TBMM better.

## Next update
Next update will include automatically downloading bibites needed for mods so you can use the mods. You will also be able to hide mods that aren't made for your selected game version

## simple roadmap
-> 0.05 is the first alpha, which was filled with bugs.

Version 0.06 will include automatically downloading bibites when you install a mod, hide mods that are not made for the selected game version and bugfixes.

Version 0.07 will add support for mods that replaces the main dll but needs other files. Example of this is MoreMaterialsMod.

Version 0.08 and 0.09 will add support for missing mods and and might also add reskin support.

Version 0.1 will be the version that every mod is compatible and can be installed. After this I will make it open source and let the community help develop it further.

After this there might be some ui updates to make TBMM look better and I will look at issues on the [issues page](https://github.com/MeltingDiamond/TBMM/issues)
