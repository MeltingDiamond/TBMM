# The Bibites Mod Manager
The Bibites Mod Manager is the unofficial mod manager for The Bibite programmed in python using tkinter. TBMM allows users to install mods with a simple gui instead off having to replace any dll manualy.
You can download and install mods with a few button clicks.
And can play both vanilla and modded with one install of The Bibites.

If you wish to modify and share TBMM outside of private use please fork it and make pull requests back to this repository for usefull changes you make. (This is based on trust) Thank you

### Find any bugs please report them [here](https://github.com/MeltingDiamond/TBMM/issues) to help make TBMM better.

## Next update
Next update will include automatically downloading bibites needed for mods so you can use the mods. Mods that aren't made for your selected game version hidden (Can select all to show all mods). You can also download versions of The Bibites that TBMM have mods for directly from TBMM. Tweaks to the UI to make it consistent for if the window is scaled.

## not so simple, but still simple roadmap
### None version specific goals
- [ ] Make a document/wiki for how to use TBMM
- [ ] Show a prompt to download and setup correct version of The Bibites when choosing a mod. This will set it up in such a way that it is integrated into TBMMs files and can be reused for other mods made for the same version.
- [ ] Add check to mods that displays if they have compatebility issue with other mods.
- [ ] Dark mode???????
### The roadmap
-> 0.05 is the first alpha, which was filled with bugs.

Version 0.06 will include automatically downloading bibites when you install a mod, hide mods that are not made for the selected game version and bugfixes.

When version 0.07 is released TBMM will support mods that replaces the main dll but needs other files. Example of this is MoreMaterialsMod. Download BepInEx automatically to choosen location (Maybe install it automatically on the selected game path will not be able to choose location if this is the case)

When version 0.08 is released TBMM will have reskin support and might add support for missing mods.

Version 0.09 will add support for at least 1 missing mod type if there are any.

Version 0.1 will be the version that every mod is compatible and can be installed (dll replace, dll replace + other external files, BepInEx and BepInEx + other external files). I will delay 0.1 untill all mentioned mod types are supported. 

After 0.1 and up I will make it open source and let the community help develop it further, there might be some ui updates to make TBMM look better and issues on the [issues page](https://github.com/MeltingDiamond/TBMM/issues) will be looked at and fixed.

Now there won't be any major version with planned features only bumps to the version whenever a new release happens. (New release happens whenever enough changes are done)

When 1.0 is released I hope it works like any other single game mod manager does and can be enjoyed by anyone of any skill level using any version.

I hope people will contibute both to TBMM directly and with mods and reskins that can be added to TBMM. Please enjoy TBMM.
